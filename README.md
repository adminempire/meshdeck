MeshDeck port for Arch Linux ARM - Wilson

This was originally ported to Arch Linux ARM Wilson repo. The Wilson repo is merging with the ArchAssault Project (http://www.archassault.org)
due to there being overlap and similar goals.

All original/upstream is done by Dr. Philip Polstra.

Taken from his Sourceforge page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/thedeck/
addon module that allows for coordinated attacks from up to a mile away using multiple devices connected via 802.15.4 networking (MeshDeck)

ToDo:
Finish port

Testing finished with 4 in swarm. Will finish remaining tests shortly. Should be good to go after next push.

Further pushing the distance
